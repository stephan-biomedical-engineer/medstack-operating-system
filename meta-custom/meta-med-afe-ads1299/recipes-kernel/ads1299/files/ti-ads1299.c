/* TI ADS1299 biopotential (EEG) front-end driver
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2023 - 2024 Topic Embedded Products
 *     drivers/iio/adc/ti-ads1298.c, Mike Looijmans <mike.looijmans@topic.nl>,
 *     mainline since Linux 6.9. This file is a derivative of that driver.
 * Copyright (C) 2026 MedPlatform (TCC)
 *
 * Provenance, because it is the point (implementation_plan_iio_afe.md §3):
 * this is NOT software of unknown provenance. It is a derivative of a driver
 * that went through the IIO maintainers' review, whose author, history and
 * review are public and citable, adapted here for the ADS1299 - the EEG
 * sibling of the ADS1298 in the same ADS129x family. The alternative that was
 * rejected was adopting an unmaintained third-party driver, which would have
 * added SOUP in the kernel's trust domain (IEC 62304 §7.1.2-7.1.3).
 *
 * Backport 6.9 -> 6.6, measured rather than assumed: every kernel interface
 * the mainline file uses exists unchanged in both kernels this repository
 * builds (linux-stm32mp 6.6.129 and linux-yocto 6.6.144) - cleanup.h and the
 * spinlock_irqsave guard, REGCACHE_MAPLE, regmap_config's .reg_read/.reg_write,
 * MICROHZ_PER_HZ, get_unaligned_be24, devm_iio_kfifo_buffer_setup. The one
 * release of API drift the plan budgeted for turned out to be zero lines.
 *
 * ADS1298 -> ADS1299: what actually differs, and why each one matters
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  - PGA gains. ADS1298 {6,1,2,3,4,8,12}; ADS1299 {1,2,4,6,8,12,24}. Same
 *    field, different table - a silent 4x scale error if carried over.
 *  - Reference. ADS1298 selects 2.4 V or 4.0 V with CONFIG3 bit 5; the ADS1299
 *    internal reference is 4.5 V and that bit is reserved. Hardcoding the
 *    ADS1298 choice would put a 12.5% gain error on every trace.
 *  - Data rate. ADS1298 has an HR/LP bit that shifts the divider by 6 or 7;
 *    the ADS1299 has no such bit, the divider shift is always 7, and the rate
 *    set is the discrete {250 .. 16000} SPS the plan's safety envelope names.
 *  - CHnSET out of reset is 0x61 on the ADS1299: gain 24 and MUX = "input
 *    shorted". A driver that does not program the MUX measures nothing and
 *    looks like it works. The ADS1298 driver never touches MUX because its
 *    reset value is the normal input.
 *  - ID register field layout differs (see the masks below).
 *
 * What this file adds beyond the adaptation
 * -----------------------------------------
 *  - A timestamp channel. The mainline driver declares none, and for a
 *    clinical record the instant a sample was converted is not optional. This
 *    is the first candidate to send back upstream.
 *  - An internal hrtimer source for boards where DRDY cannot reach the host as
 *    an interrupt - which is the USB/MCP2210 link, where the bridge offers a
 *    counted GPIO and no asynchronous delivery at all. The timestamp is then
 *    the host's, not the converter's, and the driver says so through
 *    "timestamp_source" so that no record can quietly claim more fidelity than
 *    it has.
 *  - A lost-sample counter, exported, because "samples lost under load" is one
 *    of the measurements docs/RESULTS.md §9 lists as missing.
 *  - A probe-time self test of the analogue path: the internal test generator
 *    routed to every input and its swing measured, then the inputs shorted and
 *    the noise floor measured. A front-end that fails is never registered.
 *    This is the shape of self test IEC 60601-1 §14 expects, and it lives here
 *    because judging the answer needs this part's generator amplitude and
 *    noise floor - facts no layer above the kernel may hold. Running it at
 *    probe, with no ABI of its own, is the IIO convention (adis_self_test() in
 *    drivers/iio/imu/adis.c, ak8974_selftest() in the magnetometer driver).
 *  - An input MUX control, for bench work on the analogue path.
 *
 * DATASHEET VALUES ARE UNVERIFIED. Every constant below marked [SBAS499?] was
 * written from the ADS1299 register map as understood here and has NOT been
 * checked against the datasheet or against silicon. They are collected at the
 * top of the file, in one place, precisely so that checking them is a single
 * pass. Until that pass happens they are debt, in the sense
 * BRINGUP_STM32MP2.md §11 rule 1 gives the word.

 * channel's swing to be within ADS1299_SELF_TEST_TOLERANCE_PCT of what the
 * gain implies: a dead PGA stage, a stuck gain or a broken reference all fall
 * outside it. Step 2 shorts the inputs and requires the noise floor to be under
 * ADS1299_SELF_TEST_NOISE_UV_PP. Both leave the inputs connected and the
 * generator off, pass or fail.
 *
 * A failure fails the probe. The device is never registered, so no userspace
 * can acquire from a front-end that did not pass - and the numbers that failed
 * are in the kernel log, which is the only place that can say why a front-end
